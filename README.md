Hi, I'm Natalie ðŸ‘‹

I am actuarial analyst for a consulting firm in San Francisco, and previously studied mathematics and classics (Latin focus) at the University of Oregon.

I like to use code to solve problems and create tools that can make the solutions easier to understand. For example, my [triangle counter](https://github.com/NatalieWeaver/counting-triangles) demonstrates how to solve one of my favorite problems (which I initially got wrong!) from the Eugene math circle in college.

I have experience working in R and Python, mostly for data analysis and data science as applied to actuarial ratemaking. I am a big believer in writing clean, logical code that is easy for others to use and understand. As part of this philosophy, for bigger projects I like to write code as R or Python packages. Technologies I want to learn more about include tidymodels, quarto, and shiny apps in R; and Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and XGBoost in Python.
