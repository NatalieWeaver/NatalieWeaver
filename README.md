Hi, I'm Natalie ðŸ‘‹

I currently work as an actuarial analyst for a consulting firm in San Francisco, and in a past life I was a Classics major with a Latin concentration at the University of Oregon (I also did a math major, but in the end Latin was the only subject I studied every term). 

I like to use code to solve problems and in particular to create tools that can make the solutions easier to understand. A good example of this is my [triangle counter](https://github.com/NatalieWeaver/counting-triangles), which demonstrates how to solve one of my favorite problems (which I initially got wrong!) from when I worked at the Eugene math circle in college.

My programming language of choice is R, and I have experience using caret for modeling, RMarkdown for presentation (including xaringan for slides), and the tidyverse to help with just about everything. Recently, I've been getting into R package development as well. Things I want to learn in the future include tidymodels, quarto, and shiny apps.

Besides R, I occasionally code in Python and am trying to get better at it. As part of a fun side project developing a website for work, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS and have started to dip my toes into Ruby and JavaScript. During my math major I also had a lot of fun writing Latex which, fun fact, is Turing-complete despite mostly being used as a markup language.
