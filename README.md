Hi, I'm Natalie 👋

I grew up near Seattle, studied math and Latin at the University of Oregon, and now work for an actuarial consulting firm in the Bay Area. This account hosts a collection of personal projects representing some of my interests, which include:

- math, especially math education 🧮
- LaTex (which is actually a turing-complete language!) 💯

Some of my non-technical interests include:

- playing and teaching piano 🎹
- Avatar: The Last Airbender 💨
