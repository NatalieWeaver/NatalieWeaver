Hi, I'm Natalie ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist at Milliman, an actuarial consulting firm with expertise in pricing homeowners and auto insurance; recently, we have also been studying the financial risks associated with climate events such as wildfire and flood. I previously studied mathematics and Latin at the University of Oregon, graduating summa cum laude in 2020. I am based in San Francisco.

I like to use code to solve problems and create tools that can make the solutions easier to understand. For example, my [triangle counter](https://github.com/NatalieWeaver/counting-triangles) demonstrates how to solve one of my favorite problems (which I initially got wrong!) from the Eugene Math Circle in college. My friend posted one of my triangle animations on Reddit and accidentally went slightly viral and made a lot of people angry in the comments. You can check that out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/visualizedmath/comments/dsiebp/counting_triangles/).

For similar reasons, I am a big fan of interpretable ML and have recently (as of 2025) been studying how Explainable Boosting Machines can be applied to an insurance context for both prediction and inference problems. I would love to connect with anyone else who is excited about EBMs or other interpretable ML techniques!
